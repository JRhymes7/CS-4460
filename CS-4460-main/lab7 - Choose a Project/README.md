The goal of this visualization is to visualize a dataset about movies in an interactive graph visualization.
Your visualization needs to have the following user interaction functionality (again, see the video demo for how these should appear and function).

Hovering over (mouseover) a circle (TV Show / Actor)
Brings the highlighted node into focus along with a text label showing the TV Show / Cast name (depending on what was hovered)
Also brings the immediate neighbor (connected) nodes into focus.
Displays the corresponding Detail Info Card.
Hovering out (mouseout) from a circle retains this configuration until #1 happens on a different node OR #2 or #3 happen.
Searching via the Search Input Field:
Should have both TV shows and actors by default, sorted alphabetically.
As you type, it should filter based on your search query and upon selection, you should mimic what hovering the corresponding node (circle) in the visualization does (as described in #1 above).
Clicking anywhere on the SVG outside the nodes and links (in the white-space areas) hides the Detail Info Card and defocuses the hovered node.
